Business Directory 4 4.0 README
============================================

Thank you for downloading Business Directory distribution.

This distribution includes a full working Cordova/Ionic project
source code. It's ready to run (almost) out the box.

Overview
--------

Specifically, your pack consists of the following
directories:

    * [project]
      Includes an Ionic/Cordova project. This is the project
      that can be used for development.
    * [license]
      Includes the License information and references to
      third-party licenses.

You can use the ionic project to build a final mobile application or
to create your own ionic project for any platform, as long as this
is permitted by the License. You can dig into the source psd files and
modify them the way you want and reuse, as long as this is permitted by
the License.
