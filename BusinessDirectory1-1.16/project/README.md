## Used Cordova plugins
In case that the required Cordova plugins are not installed while installing NodeJS dependencies, Cordova's command mentioned previously can be used to install the following plugins:

* **cordova-plugin-device** - This plugin defines a global device object, which describes the device's hardware and software.

* **cordova-plugin-transport-security** - Cordova / PhoneGap Plugin to allow 'Arbitrary Loads' by adding a declaration to the Info.plist file to bypass the iOS 9 App Transport Security.
* **cordova-plugin-network-information** - This plugin provides an implementation of an old version of the Network Information API. It provides information about the device's cellular and wifi connection, and whether the device has an internet connection.
* **cordova-plugin-inappbrowser** - Provides a web browser view. It could be used to open images, access web pages, and open PDF files.
* **cordova-plugin-geolocation** - Grab the current location of the user, or grab continuous location changes.
* **ionic-plugin-keyboard** - It provides functions to make interacting with the keyboard easier, and fires events to indicate that the keyboard will hide/show.
* **phonegap-plugin-push** - This plugin offers support to receive and handle native push notifications with a single unified API, and with no dependency on any other plugins. (https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugin-push.git).
* **cordova-plugin-email** - The plugin provides access to the standard interface that manages the editing and sending an email message (https://github.com/katzer/cordova-plugin-email-composer.git).
* **cordova-plugin-x-socialsharing** - Share images, text, messages via Facebook, Twitter, Email, SMS, WhatsApp, etc using this plugin (https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/SocialSharing-PhoneGap-Plugin.git).
